I am going to do it. I have made up my mind. These are the first few words of the new‚Ä¶ the best ‚Ä¶ the Longest Text In The Entire History Of The Known Universe! This Has To Have Over 35,000 words the beat the current world record set by that person who made that flaming chicken handbooky thingy. I might just be saying random things the whole time I type in this so you might get confused a lot. I just discovered something terrible. autocorrect is on!! no!!! this has to be crazy, so I will have to break all the English language rules and the basic knowledge of the average human being. I am not an average human being, however I am special. no no no, not THAT kind of special ;). Why do people send that wink face! it always gives me nightmares! it can make a completely normal sentence creepy. imagine you are going to a friend‚Äôs house, so you text this: [ see you soon üôÇ ] seems normal, right? But what is you add the word semi to that colon? (Is that right? or is it the other way around) what is you add a lorry to that briquettes? (Semi-truck to that coal-on) anyway, back to the point: [ see you soon üòâ ]THAT IS JUST SO CREEPY! is that really your friend, or is it a creepy stalker watching your every move? Or even worse, is it your friend who is a creepy stalker? maybe you thought it was your friend, but it was actually your fri end (let me explain: you are happily in McDonalds, getting fat while eating yummy food and some random dude walks up and blots out the sun (he looks like a regular here) you can‚Äôt see anything else than him, so you can‚Äôt try to avoid eye contact. he finishes eating his cheeseburger (more like horseburgher(I learned that word from the merchant of Venice(which is a good play(if you can understand it(I can cause I got a special book with all the words in readable English written on the side of the page(which is kinda funny because Shakespeare was supposed to be a good poet but no-one can understand him(and he‚Äôs racist in act 2 scene1 of the play too))))))) and sits down beside you , like you are old pals (you‚Äôve never met him before but he looks like he could be in some weird cult) he clears his throat and asks you a very personal question. ‚Äúcan i have some French fries?‚Äù (I don‚Äôt know why there called French fries when I‚Äôve never seen a French person eat fries! all they eat it is stuff like baguettes and cr√™pes and rats named ratty-two-ee which is a really fun game on the PlayStation 2) And you think {bubbly cloud thinking bubble} ‚ÄúHahahahahhahahahahahahahaha!!!!!!!!!!!! Hehheheheheh‚Ä¶..heeeheehe..hehe‚Ä¶ sigh. I remember that i was just about to eat one of my fries when I noticed something mushy and moist and [insert gross color like green or brown] on the end of one of my fries! now I can give it to this NERD!! ‚Äù (yes he is a nerd because all he does all day is watch the extended editions of the hobbit, lord of the rings and star wars and eat fat cakes (what the heck is a fat cake? I think it might be like a Twinkie or something)and twinkies(wow so is doesn‚Äôt really matter which is which because he eats both(i may have just done that so I didn‚Äôt have to Google what a fat cake is (right now I am typing on my iPhone 3gs anyway, which has a broken antenna so i can‚Äôt get internet anyway (it‚Äôs actually a really funny story that i‚Äôll tell you sometime)))and sit in his man cave with his friend named Joe (an ACTUAL friend, not a fri end)and all Joe does is watch sports like football with bob and all bob does is gamble ferociously (don‚Äôt ask(it means he buys all those bags of chips that say ‚Äúwin a free monkey or something if you find a banana in your bag*‚Äù(if there is a little star it means there is fine print so I always check the back of the package) *flips over the package* okay, it says: ‚Äúone of our workers accidentally threw a banana in the packing machine and we don‚Äôt want to get sued so we did this promotion thing‚Äù cool. Oh wow, this is salt and vinegar! my favourite! i hate cheese and onion.))and that‚Äôs pretty much his life, he lives in Jamaica with Naruto and his friends) so you give him that gross fri end he throws up all over you and me and the worker behind the counter who was still making an onion, and THAT is the story of the fri end, not a friend who somehow remembered your name and your phone number / email so he could text you saying he would come to your house soon. *finally takes a breath after typing a few hundred words about fri-ends* so what now? i know, i know, you think i ramble too much and use too many brackets (i don‚Äôt) but now i am going to talk about my amAZEing day. first i woke up, ate choco pops for breakfast even tho i always hate it when people say that cause i get jealous and super hungry. then i‚Ä¶ umm‚Ä¶ yea! that was my day. you know that other person i mentioned before? that flaming chicken person? WELL. i will steal something from that person but do it better. i will‚Ä¶ drum roll please ‚Ä¶ badabadabadabadabadabadabummmmmmmmmmmchshchshchshchshbadabadboumboumpoopoopichypichypichypowpow-crash! *a drum roll was just playing in the background* that drumroll was so long i forget what i was talking about. *scrolls up to see what he was writing about* oh yea! i will make my own FLAMING CHICKEN HANDBOOK! what things do i like? instead of flaming it could be rainbow, instead of chicken it could be fluffysheep and instead of handbook it could be handbook (not very creative, i know) but the total complete name is now to rainbow fluffysheep handbook! to make life easier for you guys, instead of taking random rules out of book willy nilly, i will take them out using my favourite numbers! so, section 5040 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook states that the king of all oddly coloured farm animals (thats me!) is allowed to tell you any part out of this book randomly or if it is his one of his favorite numbers! 5040 is a great number because it is divisible by 60 integers which i don‚Äôt know. i‚Äôm tired. it is 10:41 and i am getting sleepy‚Ä¶ hey hey hey! an intruder! remember that from pokepals rulers of time and darkness or something like that! with piplup and sunflora and chimchar! whaoh piplup is really hard to write on a tiny qwerty keyboard! try it! i realised that asdf is actually written in order on the qwerty keyboard! (just in case you didn‚Äôt know, asdf is an amazing short video clips cartoony thing on youtube i first learned bout on flipnote hatena, which is now shut down üò¶ ) what if one day they get rid of the qwerty keyboard completely! i will type it out for you just in case one day they get rid of it. qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm. there u go. Goodbye. I‚Äôm back! i decided that i should tell you about fonts. i always used the same font for my whole life, called arial. the reason is probably because it is on the top of the list in alphabetical order, and i was too lazy to scroll all the way down. only a few months ago did i finally decide to change my mind. i scrolled for what seemed to be an eternity, and i finally got to‚Ä¶ are you ready ‚Ä¶ arial black. yep, that was my big SCROLLING ADVENTURE! just yesterday, i was typing something on google docs and i found the new best font : roboto. its great! i could choose from FIVE different thicknesses. isn‚Äôt that amazing? right now we are driving behind a really slow ‚Äúfarm plastics collection‚Äù semi. i think i know someone obsessed with pokemon, but i can‚Äôt tell you who it is. he keeps making pokepals references and stuff. wow! you are a very loyal reader! if you have REALLY made it this far then you‚Ä¶ get a gold star on your loyalty chart! good job! this is looking to be the longest text ever, considering that this was all written in one day. i don‚Äôt understand sandwiches. if you were to eat bread, mayo and tomatoes separately it would be disgusting! you know all those fancy magazines/restaurants that always have really fancy food pictures with meat and brussels sprouts and all the old people say ‚Äúwow! that looks great!‚Äù and you think {bubble thing} ‚Äúit looks like the worst thing anyone could ever eat‚Äù and the you eat it and it tastes surprisingly‚Ä¶ WORSE than you imagined! gotta go‚Ä¶ im back! ive ive got stuff to say! your probably thinking‚Ä¶ HoW DoEs He HaVe So MuCh FrEe TiMe?!?! And the answer is‚Ä¶ i don‚Äôt. that‚Äôs right. this isn‚Äôt just some SIDE project. i‚Äôve gotta make time to do this if wanna get the world record. for all i know, the flaming chicken opponent who i will refer to from now on as sam (i don‚Äôt know why) is probably still adding to her posts. (i think i picked sam because it sounds like ham which is like cooked meat and so is flaming chicken, so you will remember that now ) i am officially going to make a quote from the rainbow fluffysheep handbook of knowledge and prestige (sounds catchy, huh?) . section 777 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook STATES that the king of oddly colored farm animals (thats me!) is allowed to use whatever font he wants to. [now, i know what your thinking reader, that has nothing to do with anything. but it will come in handy someday (maybe)] sam makes me feels sick! im offended! (probably because i‚Äôm jealous of how much is written on that website(i dont even know how to make a website)) I‚ÄôVE JUST BEEN READING THIS AND I HAVE DISCOVERED A CONSPIRACY! THAT‚ÄôS RIGHT, I AM WORKING FOR DOCTOR SUESS! YES! i will prove it to you. i mentioned ham and sickness so green eggs and ham somehow! (why is he called doctor suess anyway? he‚Äôs not even a doctor *citation needed* and his books are kinda dumb! (funny considering i‚Äôm the one making that statement)) talking about eggs, aren‚Äôt eggs practically unborn chicken membrane? wouldn‚Äôt it be scary if you were casually eating your brembudder (riotous robots reference (wow! serious compilation of alliteration dedication!)) and drinking your tae wit‚Äô da guv‚Äôna (england doesn‚Äôt even have a govna! *citation needed*)(i‚Äôm not even racist i‚Äôm just quoting an accent of a race) and you go to crack an egg for your brekkie and BOOM! and unborn chicken embryo starts running towards you, picks up a knife and starts screaming ‚ÄúMAMA! MAMA!‚Äù you are so scared that you grab the nearest weaponry (a spoon) and poke the hideous beast. it is unaffected. luckily, the govener of Berwick-Upon-Tweed throws a sugar cube directly into the chicks mouth! as you know, sugar is EXTREMELY poisonous to chicken embryos *citation needed* (no more citations!) and you are saved! i‚Äôm sick and tired of citations! i will quote from the official rainbow fluffysheep handbook! section 12345679 (all the mathematicians are nodding their heads while the OCD people are twitching nervously in the corner) says that the king of oddly coloured farm animals does not have any obligation to write if a false piece of information needs a citation. great! now i feel like a free person! free i tell you, free! free from the prison cell i call the boundaries of untrue info. i think since im going to be the president of somewhere someday, i should have great speech here it goes: Hello great people of [name of place]! i am here to tell you; I am going to make [name of place] great again! i am going to lower taxes, but increase happiness! i am going to buy dog sweaters and bowls for people with dogs, and do some renovations on peoples tents! yes, this truly is a new era, the era of Epicness And Coolness! {and so, his tale lived on forever, being passed on generation to generation, living vividly in the hearts of the people.(that last bit sounded like the ending of an Asterix comic.)} i will now PROVE that all these things can happen. the first thing i said was that i will make America (i know, i know, i gave it away and told you the name) place grape again. (yes, that is what i said, bear with me here) i hereby DECLARE that every piece of American soil must be covered in vineyards. someone told me i should do that. i think i heard it through the grapevine (bad jokethat nobody understands) the next step is to lower taxes and raise happiness. to lower taxes i will get rid of all hospitals, and spend the taxes all on building fun playgrounds. this in turn, raises happiness (for the kids and for the non-injured if you know what i mean). finally, i will buy dog sweaters (on sale at your local liquidation world!) and dog bowls (just use little human bowls maybe?) and last but not least i will do renos on peoples tents (send chip and joanna from Fixer Upper to all the camping places). and, since all i said was (partial) truth, it will be a great era. anyway, gotttttttttttaaaaaaa ggggoooooo. bbbbbuuuuuuyyyy! im back. i just had thanksgiving while listening to christmas music and it was fun. we had bacon, ham and chicken but no turkey. its fall, but it‚Äôs ACTUALLY winter secretly. im watching a funny show. i‚Äôm back (even though i never said i was gone so you might be confused) hello loyal reader! if you have gotten this far without SKIMMING THROUGH then you are probably either lying, extremely bored (but not after reading this whole thing!) or VERY and i mean VERY dedicated. or all three. you know those homeless people that sit on the ground and ask for money? i think its all a conspiracy! after all, uow can they afford those dogs, sharpies, cardboard and enough english education to write ‚Äúneed help‚Äù? back in the roman times, only the richest, most important people could get things like that! you know the new fad, ‚Äòblack surfboards‚Äô? (neither did i until 15 seconds ago) someone related to me thinks they look really cool, i think they are neat but SOMEONE also related to me thinks they are bad because they would get warped. someWHERE ohohohohohohover the rainbowwwwww that reminds me, i was doing my normal thing, when BOOM! i started typing NONSENSE. so here it is, but be warned. its SCARILY NONSENSICAL. HeRe GoEs: The Epicness ‚Äì Hi how are you? Smells good ya! Think about that buddy (shower time) heheheheHAHAHA well thanks a lot so called buddy. Random things: joe be utterly hatin.

I‚Äôm back! and i gotta new conspiracy for u! you know how EVERY child hates brussels sprouts! this is why i think so. Brussels sprouts were happily growing in their belgiumy home. everyone loved them! they were the chicken nuggets of the vegetable world. when suddenly‚Ä¶ DA DADA DA! Hitler comes to Belgium (dont read this if you don‚Äôt want to. hitler was happily taking over Austria and Poland when he then decided to take over France but France built a big wall thing to keep him out on the border between france and Germany so all Hitler did was go through Belgium to get to France and THAT is when our story is taking place.) and he makes all the brussles sprouts taste bad simply because he is near them! the Mulligan family is about to go to McRonalds and order 43 brussels sprouts (you would have to have been paying very close attention and know some math to understand that joke) and when they get them (after lots of quarrels with the manager (a bit of a parker square if you ask me (you probably don‚Äôt understand that either(if you want to feel like you know all these inside jokes, just look em up on the web! your sure to find the videos made by lumberpile(close enough))))) they taste so bad you throw up everywhere! Hitler may have caused WWII, but he also caused brussels sprouts to taste bad. so there you go. why do they always write WWII? (if you can‚Äôt tell, they always write double-u double-u eye eye) wouldn‚Äôt it be more accurate to write WW11 or WW2? If i keep writing at this rate, i‚Äôll beat the world record in no time! i might even print it all off and write a novel! too bad i probably don‚Äôt have any readers. hello there non existent reader! i hope you are having fun. and i hope you are not injured cuz of that whole ‚Äòno hospitals‚Äô conundrum. what else should i talk about? how bout Minecraft? just in case you don‚Äôt know, Minecraft is a fun game where you place blocks and stuff and you play with friends and most people who play it are like 10 years old but I not and i still have fun and you can‚Äôt judge me because I wanna be an engineer and if I wanna be an engineer then i should probably not waste my time playing games wow that went downhill from benefitting me really quickly. Anyway, I prefer the Redstone side of things (Redstone means wiring and stuff). I build stuff like 5 piston extenders and auto wall builders and calculators and computers (not those stupid computers that use command blocks (just in case you don‚Äôt know people, command blocks are like CHEATING THINGS and if I am talking about them i will probably not be happy)) and stuff cause i wanna be an inventor. I also do c++ and make things like search engines, text adventures and cookie clickers! My current BIGGEST project is 600 lines long and I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs a lot but it sure seems like it to me! (when I was typing in the word lines it auto corrected it to ‚Äòlies‚Äô) what‚Äôs with the whole naming appliances fad going on? (There isn‚Äôt really one) like that vacuum named ‚ÄòHenry‚Äô that I have. I have the box here and it says on it it can twist the top part which I never knew before! I just woke up but the anticipation of whether this whole Henry twist bit this is true is killing me and I think I might wake up just to see if its true. Nahhhhhhhhhhh! This text is getting so long it‚Äôs getting laggy just typing on the same notes on my phone! I gotta start a new one.

I don‚Äôt even remember typing that! It‚Äôs so late a night my eyes are bulging out of my sockets because of the brightness on my phone! Now, I know what your thinking. TURN DOWN THE BRIGHTNESS, KING OF RAINBOWFLUFFYSHEEP! I will tell you why I shall not. Because on an iPhone 3 there is no easy access to get to your brightness. That‚Äôs for the WIMP. I‚Äôm hardcore. That‚Äôs why I Have typed a step by step tutorial on how to change the brightness on an iphone3 for you to read, in the comfort of your own home! (Or wherever your exciting life takes you) 1. Click the button on the top right of the phone to turn it on. 2. Swipe from the left to the right on the bottom of the screen. 3. Type in your password and the phone will unlock to the home screen. 4. Click on the Settings App (Your Almost There!) 5. Click on the ‚ÄòBrightness/Wallpaper‚Äô Tab. 6. GOOD JOB! ALL U HAVE TO DO IS SWIPE THE LITTLE BAR THINGY! that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt do that. I don‚Äôt have THAT much time. I think. Halloo! I‚Äôm in London and I‚Äôm hangin out! Now I‚Äôm back though. This is extremely frightening. Whenever I type words then my phone reads it out to me. Strange.I just turned it off. Good thing too, since every time i heard it i turned around and punched the wall. Not out of fear for my life because of the impending imminent doom, but out of a pure piqued curiosity. Once you obliterate the wall once, every latter time you lose that satisfying crunch. One thing I have aspired to accomplish for a long time now is to make my own pun-themed conspiracy theory. Here goes: in section number 115132219018763992565095597973971522401 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook (i am very proud of that number by the way(*cue all geeks Laughing hysterically*)) STATES that the shearer of greatness (who‚Äôs that again?) has proof the the solvence of the illuminati (if you solve something, would it be called an act of solvence?) and forherbyshared proclaimences all right to own half of all southern states who share barbeque preferences (none([southern dialect] it ju bring a tear to ma eye knowin tha the founding fathers fought for freedum, an‚Äô fer unitee. Ye still the states Connor decide on a preferred bar bee q sawse :()) even if he does not want them. And now gentlemen and ladies, I will prove once and for all that the illuminati ‚Ä¶ Is real. Here goes: So, as everyone knows, the illuminati is represented by the pyramid with an eye in the centre. Do you think that it is merely a COINCIDENCE that the first letter in illuminati is i, and I is pronounced ‚Äòeye‚Äô? I THINK NOT! Let‚Äôs continue. What is the first thing you think of when you hear the word pyramid? Exactly! The first thing you think of is Egypt? Nooooo!! It‚Äôs that they‚Äôre big. Duh. So what is the first thing that you would say when seeing a pyramid? ‚ÄúWow that‚Äôs big?‚Äù No of course not random audience members indicated by the two line things! You would make the sounds of a mesmerised chimp, like ‚ÄúOooooh‚Äù and ‚ÄúAhhhhhhh‚Äù. And I know how these two things are connected! What temperature would it be in Egypt? Hot, that‚Äôs what! So hot that it feels like you are cooking a pan. Ahhhhhhhhhh pan, to be precise! And what county sounds like apan? Japan? Now is it just a COINCIDENCE that that Japanese word for big is ‚ÄòOo‚Äô? NOOO!!! These things are all connected, I just don‚Äôt fully know how yet. So, we know that the answer has something to do with being big, but what? for these kind of questions, you have to work backwards. I call this method, Reverse Solvency. Anyway, what did the rich (big) people do to the poor (not big) Egyptians around the time that the pyramids were built? Exactly! They sold em‚Äô that sounds like soldier! In French that‚Äôs gendarme! Gender! That‚Äôs what they are trying to tell us! It‚Äôs so obvious, in front of our very EYEs from the beginning! So, what gender is associated with being big! (This is gonna be slightly offensive) Males, obviously! (I‚Äôm sorry üò¶ *audience member calls out* don‚Äôt be sexist! Sorry, but you have to admit, men are usually fatter than women! ‚ÄúHey, now you‚Äôre being sexist to males! We have our rights, you know!!! Chauvinists! Communists! We are great! Who insists? Communists! We will rule with hate!!! ‚Äù ummm actually I was saying that men are fatter because back in the time of the PYRAMIDS if you were fat you were considered wealthy. ‚ÄúNow your sexist to us again! Feminists rule! Feminists are great! We are going to rule with hate!!‚Äù If you both want to rule with hate , just hate each other equally so this can be over with!!!! Thank you. Anyway, back to the conspiracy) Where were we? Oh yes. Men! What word has men in it? Fishermen, of course! Fishermen caught a lot of fish, and what did the Egyptians have a lot of? Gods! Fishermen used to go slow in boats, so we can remove the g forces, and we a left with ‚Äòod‚Äô. And where are the fishermen!?!? In the sea! The ‚Äòc‚Äô! And what kind of fish do they catch? That‚Äôs right, the ‚ÄòCod‚Äô! Now, we use are backwards method to come up with ‚ÄòDoc‚Äô. As in a doctor! What does a doctor do? Helps people who are sick! But do you know what the worst thing about doctors is? You still have the pay the doctors fee even if you are not sick! And mind you, the doctors fee is quite a large bill, and I wouldn‚Äôt want to go to the doctor not even for a bee sting! Alas, This is as far as I have gotten. Can anyone help me? Um yes, you? ‚ÄúYes, I was just wondering what Big, men , ooo, not bees, Bills , and sickness have to so with the Illuminati! ‚Äù wait anonymous audience member say that again! ‚ÄúBut like, it was a lot of words‚Äù [the writer remembers that he is not allowed to copy and paste, so he skips the dramatic scene where one character says his sentence again while the Maine character says aha! I think I got it!] ‚Äúgot what? The flu?‚Äù Who the heck are you? And how did you get backstage? Security?!?! SECURITY!!!!! ‚Äúyes sir?‚Äù What are you guys wearing?! ‚ÄúObviously we are wearing tiger skins, for camouflage!‚Äù Now I don‚Äôt even have security to take all the psychopathic people in here, because my security are psychopathic themselves!!! Annnyyywwwaaayyy‚Ä¶ I figured it out! Bill, no bee and sick! No bee is actually no ‚ÄòB‚Äô, the letter! The only b we have is in bill! And if you take it off, what do you get. ‚Äúill‚Äù . And what is a synonym for ill. Sick. We have gotten pretty far on our journey of solving the question of the illuminati, although we have not quite accomplished the full desired outcome yet. What did all the most important people in egypt do when they were not prosecuting the poor? They were eating, of course! And what were the poor doing in their spare time? What any law-abiding heartwarming lovely citizens would be doing? Playing Sports, of course? And where are the rich buried? In coffins like boxes. When someone dies, hey eyes turn into 24pt roboto thin-line x‚Äôs in italics. Huh; box, x. An XBox of course! And what company makes sports for an Xbox? Electronic arts. We‚Äôve all heard of ‚ÄòE A Sports. It‚Äôs In The Game.‚Äô.if the rich are ‚Äòeat‚Äô and the poor are ‚Äòea‚Äô the only letter not used in both is the letter T! As in tea! A tea is going to come in handy. Even the word eat is just an anagram for tea! It‚Äôs all starting to make sense to me now! It‚Äôs all fitting together like the pieces of child‚Äôs jigsaw! Remember the plagues on Egypt? One of those must be a clue, but which one!? For this, we need to go back to original illuminati ideas, the eye and the triangle. What number do they have in common? 3, of course! A triangle has three sides! If you asked someone to draw a shape and the only hint you have them as to which shape it is was to tell them ‚Äò3‚Äô, then chances are they would draw a triangle! It even has three in its name ‚Äì tri-angle! And how many color cones does an eye have? You guessed it, three. And the third plague is: let‚Äôs see here‚Ä¶ Gnats. What has a gnat got to do with anything? That information is probably gnat even right (LOLZ)! Anyway, let‚Äôs keep going, there must be more to discover yet still. Who was the last pharaoh in Egypt? Cleopatra. She‚Äôs so famous, that there have been books and movies made about her! The movies would have been very old, if they were made when she was alive. So old in fact, that they probably used those old cameras with the crank thingy on the side and the reels. Remember the fishermen from before! They connect! The ‚Äòreels‚Äô! I think we now have all the information we need to prove that the illuminati is real. Lets see, what do we have: ill, oo, men, a tea, is gnat, reel. What happens if we squish them all together. Illoomenateaisgnatreel. Illoomenatea is gnat reel. Oh. Well, good thing we got that cleared up. Guess what peeps? I have made it to 35000 characters! Why is that so significant, you might ask? Because the world record is 35000 words! That means that all I have to do is replace every letter with a word. Like this: instead of writing ‚ÄòI‚Äôm back!‚Äô I could say ‚Äòinternet mascara beagle Australia catamaran kipper‚Äô and all you do is read the first letter! This would probably make for some nonsensical blubber, as one might say, but at least i‚Äôll beat the record! Also I have another Up-to-standard word idea to get more writing in! Instead of just writing a normal sentence I replace all the words with their respective dictionary definition! Yes, writer, that is a good awesome cool convenient and simple idea! So here goes: ‚Äòjumping cacti ate many jars containing marmalade‚Äô -> ‚Äòany of numerous succulent plants of the family Cactaceae, of warm, arid regions of the New World, having fleshy, leafless, usually spiny stems, and typically having solitary, showy flowers that are leaping or springing over an object the past tense of to take into the mouth and swallow for nourishment constituting or formulating a large number of a broad-mouthed container, usually cylindrical and of glass or earthenware currently holding or including within its volume or area a jelly-like preserve in which small pieces of fruit and fruit rind, as of oranges or lemons, are suspended.‚Äô Wow, that took longer than I expected. Just so I don‚Äôt get sued, I am now informing you that those pieces of information were sourced from a well-designed, helpful and informative website currently named dictionary.com. And now, a word from our sponsor. *Kshhhhhhh* Have you ever been sick before? Then this pill is for you! We have a 100% guarantee that you will never get sick again!

Kshhhhhhh thank you for that lovely message from our sponsor, hooey kablooie. I need a topic. Not just any topic that you find on the floor, but a topic so magnifico, so delisimo, and so interestinio, that I that I fall on the ground in a seizure. I got one! This is a short skit entitled: ninjas: explorers of time and space! *intense music builds* yes sensei! I will punch that piece of wood so hard that it creates a wormhole in the 6th dimension! My apprentice, you have trained hard. There is now a one in one times ten to the million chance that using this wormhole will send us to a earth-like planet that will be habitable for all ninjas in the clan of the ninjapeeps. All hail the ninjapeeps! (You don‚Äôt actually have to) who said that?! Who would have the audacity to threaten the ninjapeeps all hail the ninjapeeps in such a way! I did. And you are? The Writer. Nice to meet you, my name is senseinohi, but that‚Äôs sensei to you. Howdy pawtna! No, we are actually japanese, not texan. Kong-nae-chae-waw, pawtna! Sensei, don‚Äôt respond! Don‚Äôt you remember what this man did? No. He was the one who disarmed the hailing of the ninjapeeps all hail the ninja peeps! Oh yes, that‚Äôs right. Sorry dude, but PREPARE TO BE THROWN INTO THE SIXTH DIMENSION, YOU DIRTY RASCAL! The sensei grabbed his handheld torpedo launcher and shot it at The Writer. It hit him and pushed him into the board! Do it! The Apprentice hit the board with all his might, and it broke apart. Not how you would think though, it actually compressed into a wormhole, shifting the spacetime fabric around it! (Now I know what you‚Äôre thinking, reader. Don‚Äôt ‚ÄòThey‚Äô always say to make a story believable!? And to that I say‚Ä¶ but it is. You see, if you are a small minded gherkin (hey! You! No insults or we‚Äôre going to have to stop this little ‚Äòplay‚Äô of yours!) ok‚Ä¶ whatever. You probably believe that when you push something, the far side of it moves instantly, right? WELL YOU‚ÄôD BE WRONG! Actually, the opposite side of the object moves in the same time it would take for sound to travel from you to it. Here‚Äôs an example: there is a lightning bolt with a hand far away from you. When it strikes the ground, it pushes a meal pole towards you, so one end is in its hand while the other is in yours. You will get pushed back at the exact time you hear to thunder! Isn‚Äôt that fabulous? That means that if the ninja punches faster than the speed of sound (a lot faster though) then he will be able to compress the board into a space time warping black hole) The Writer is plunged into the endless oblivion of the cascading incomprehension that is the sixth dimension. Little did the ninja peeps all hail the ninja peeps know, when you are in the sixth dimension, you can teleport right inside people and objects! (It actually depends on what kind of sixth dimension you are in. If you are in a four axes two time dimension, as in this skit, you can moves backwards and forwards in time and change the outcome of time, yet not travel directly to any possible outcome which you may have formed in the past. Also, with another axes under your belt, you can essentially disappear and reappear at will, yet with a time delay, which is nulled due to your cacophony of dimensions, specifically time.) so what The Writer did next was simple! He simply went back in time, and landed inside the sensei, causing him to not be thrown into the wormhole, causing him not to land in the sensei‚Ä¶ This is making less sense as we go. In the end, the universe gets confused, and tells us a message: universe.exe has stopped responding. Noooooooooooooooo ‚Äî Yep. And that is what I do with my life essentially. Gotta go now sea ya! I‚Äôm back! With a conspiracy that will blow your minds/mind if you are human! Zooreka is the easiest game to play if you have the slightest bit of mathematical knowledge! When choosing what to roll for, it is sooooo obvious which on the choose using basic knowledge. I‚Äôm not going to tell you, because next time you play it you will figure it out (if you even HAVE zooreka). Now that I think About it, that wasn‚Äôt really a conspiracy, was it :(. I have a reward for you reader. If you have truly made it this far than‚Ä¶ Give me your email and I will send you the answer to the zooreka challenge, free of charge! Send an email to rainbowfluffysheep123@gmail.com, inquiring. Also, you can ask me any other important questions you might have! In section 18w08b of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook it CLEARLY STATES that the king of oddly colored farm animals (that‚Äôs me!) will reply to ANY email set to the inbox of rainbowfluffysheep123@gmail.com to the best of his ability (not including spam tho). Hey! I just realised that when I wrote the word color, it get a red squiggle underneath! What a sham! ShamWOW! In section 18o25g02i22 it states that anyone, not only the king of the oddly colored farm animals, is allowed to spell color without a u! Hurrah! Hurrah! Three cheers for the rainbow fluffysheep handbook! (But that was only two, Harold. Whatever.) and that, ladies and gentlemen, was the way Color was born. THE END. I‚Äôm back! And do I have an exciting subject for you! No! I don‚Äôt! Ha, gotcha there, didn‚Äôt I! Wow, it just started raining. Oh wait, it‚Äôs snow! Not just any snow, mind you, but it‚Äôs topicsnow! Yay! All these great topics falling softly from the sky. What could be better. I‚Äôm now walking down the street. Hey you! Ye? Is that a topicman? Yes sir, tis! Well ain‚Äôt that great. If want to get the best topics, I must climb mt.Big. Hey look, there‚Äôs some kids having a topicball fight! How fun. Noooooo! A topicalanche! (That doesn‚Äôt even make sense!!! The word avalanche doesn‚Äôt even have the world snow in it! ) Since I died, i didn‚Äôt get any topics. Sooooooo yea. *cue awkward elevator music* ding do do ding dong ding do do ding dong. *taps his foot* *hums 90‚Äôs pop song* grabs chainsaw from behind his ear and cuts the elevator cord, plunging the box of awkwardness in to the darkness of forgetfulness and loss of meaning. Forget‚Ä¶ Forget‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. You drift into a deep dreamless sleep, waking up to an elevator of twisted metal wreckage resembling a dead animal carcasses. Beside is the corpse of‚Ä¶ of‚Ä¶ an onion?!?! Wow, who knew onions could be so awkward :o. I just read what I wrote and it makes less sense than I thought. Little did you guys know, that today you would get a great piece of text to read. I didn‚Äôt even know that. You know that guy from shamWOW! He always said all these great things about that weird sponge? Yea, that was a short topic. Im gone. Im back! Wait, how did i type if i was gone? With my mmmiiiinnnnddddd‚Ä¶ woooooooo creeeeeeeepy! Anyway, this is what i was thinking. I feel really sorry for water molecules! All they do all their lives is slowly get raised up slowly until they land in a cloud with their friends! Wahoo! Or, so you think. In reality, at any moment they could fall to their impending doom! They drop thousands of meters to the ground, only now realizing that they are miles from home!! They take the nearest river trying to get home, before repeating the cycle! They teach us this horror story in kindergarten, masking the brutal morbidity of it by articulating the conundrum using macroscopic convoluted words! Like ‚Äòevaporation‚Äô, more like flying up to the sky knowing that it‚Äôs your final moment ‚Äì ation! Condensation!?!? More like con ‚Äì ned by your kindergarten teacher inti thinking that this means water gently floating to the surface of the earth, when it really means death by lack of parachute! How could you be so ‚Äì dense ‚Äì ation! (Public service announcement: this is an anonymous relative spakin‚Äô: *where is he? Dunno.* this was test, and only a test. Had this been a real public service announcement then i would have ‚Äì not been here! Harharhar ! Stop making fun of harold! He was only late for that one clock commercial and now you guy just have to ‚Äì its OK bob, i don‚Äôt care about the Larry squad. They don‚Äôt bother me no longer. KK harold‚Ä¶.. umm‚Ä¶ this was a te ‚Äì wait, did we already do that part? Uh, ya i think so‚Ä¶. so this is awkward. Ya, sooooooo ‚Äì *in the echoey distance* cut to the commercial break! What the heck do i pay you for? To‚Ä¶ get‚Ä¶ you‚Ä¶ coffee, sir. Oh, you the coffee boy? Why the hack did my coffee not have any cream in it yesterday!? I almost burnt my mouth into non-existence! I was told not to put in in, sir. By who? Lets just say i got a‚Ä¶ Higher Calling. You‚Ä¶ you m-m-mean that The Boss called? Yes, budget cuts he said. No more cream he said. No more name-brand cereal! Nooooo if my cereal is packed in a bag i swear on my neighbors cousins dogs bone that i will take every cereal bag, pour out all the cereal, and put them into the boxes that i saved from the name brand cereal!!! Is this‚Ä¶ you‚Ä¶ you wouldn‚Äôt. Oh, try me. Yea, now that i think about it you probably would do that. Why was i here again? Oh ya‚Ä¶ CUT TO A COMMERCIAL ALREADY! We don‚Äôt have any commercials sir, we got voted unanimously by popular vote not to have any commercials. Well obviously the public didn‚Äôt want‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ di- it all makes sense now! The budget cut is BECAUSE of us not playing enough commercials! But sir, our quota ends tomorrow! We need to have played 50837 commercials! There is. Only. One. Way. Play all the commercials at 100x speed! Is that even LeGaL?! Of course it is! We might have to have an epilepsy warning at the start though. Don‚Äôt people get epilepsy from watching fast images? This is a radio station, so people can just hear it! Ummm‚Ä¶ this is an earlepsy warning! HAHAHAHAAHAHAHAAHhahahahhahha hehe he‚Ä¶ heh. That wasn‚Äôt funny, steven.) And back to our regular program. I just started a sentence with a preposition! Isn‚Äôt that, like, seven years bad luck or something? Well I can solve that. Section 1 of the Rainbow Fluffysheep handbook says that the king of oddly colored (not coloured like some LOSERS would write) farm animals has full veto to start any sentence with a preponderance. (What the hooey is a preponderance? It says here that it means to be greater than something. Well, the king of oddly colored is full of preponderance towards everyone else! Mwahahaahaha!) Now i can start with a preposition too. Well that worked. (The reason that I used the number 1 is because it has become forgotten among numbers. You see, 1 isn‚Äôt considered a prime number! Like what the hey! Its only factors are one and itself!) Do you think that when a particle is beckoned into existence, it uses one of those slot machines with the big arm? And the 777 of the particle world is getting‚Ä¶ Hmmmm. I actually have now idea. Maybe just hydrogen! Hydrogen is pretty sweet for blowing people up. But then when your becoming a particle, you have to use it and see what you get. A typical particle would be at one. Here is an example: *cue southern accent* sweat was rolling down my face like the Rolling Stones. I can‚Äôt believe it has come to this. I force my hand over to the lever on the side of the machine, which appeared to be taunting me. It‚Äôs lights and horror movie little-kid-singing-or-jack‚Äìin‚Äìthe‚Äìbox (the reason i did that is because I was putting a space between every word, AND jack-in-the-box already has them too) seemed to violently clash against the darkness and dread of the outside world. I clenched the red metal ball with all my might. It was cold as Alaskan ice on a early winter morning, and its color was the blood of the many particles who had to go through with this also. I jerked my limb backwards, causing the huge metal pole to turn on a skewed axis. It came to a stop after turning a quarter of the way with a hard crack, like the crack of a whip. I refocused my attention to the screen. The cylinders were rolling faster than A grands prix racers tyre. Suddenly, the first one came to an abrupt halt. I stared at it, but struggled to read the letter because of my complete shock. H. It said H. I should have been happy, I know, but I wasn‚Äôt completely out of the woods yet. There was a tiny times two symbol beside it. I didn‚Äôt care. I pulled the arm again, not knowing what life-changing, devastating thing was to come. It spinning thing that doesn‚Äôt have a name stopped. O. No. It was the letter O! Now I too will have to live this tortuous fate! Do you think that water parties breathe? Because then, when they did, they would just be hydrogen for a very short amount of time. ENOUGH WITH THE WATER PARTICLES!! I have a conspiracy theory! You know those spinny poles that barbers have? Of course you do! They are probably used to hypnotise people into getting their hair cut there! #subSPINinalmessagesfromcruelbarbers. There is a haircut called ‚Äúmeet me at McDonald‚Äôs‚Äù that is BANNED where I live. goodbye. and remember‚Ä¶ barbers are eevviill! I‚Äôm back! Did you know that palm trees aren‚Äôt actually trees? Yea, that‚Äôs right, palm TREES!!! I think that they‚Äôre bushes or something. That makes me angry! in section 6.02214129√ó10^23 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook it says that trees are trees.. no matter how small (Horton hears a who). On a completely unrelated note, there was this old man who painted a baseball like infinite times so now it‚Äôs like the size of a truck. I was listening to this amazing radio station and this is ACTUALLY what it was about. I will try to rein-act it as accurately as possible. ‚ÄúRecently, a Russian double-agent was poisoned in England. Also, there was a man who had ten million euros, which he gambled until he got nine million of it back. he was so mad that he didn‚Äôt get it all, that he robbed his employers to get the money back. now he is a counsellor for people struggling with a gambling addiction. he‚Äôs a great lad, he is, he‚Äôs had a great life. By the way, its my mother in laws 100th birthday today! Go over to her house and say hello! I have her post code written on the back of my phone. Also, there was a man who invented the windup radio and the shoe phone charger who died this week.‚Äù I know what you‚Äôre thinking: there‚Äôs no way this actually happened, right? YES THIS WAS REAL! And I thought it was pretty funny hehehe. I need write all o the funny things that happen in my life in here. So today I was in the library, minding my own business, when I noticed someone was drawing cartoons and there were a whole bunch of little kids surrounding him (I‚Äôm guessing from ages 2-5). Classic movie plot device that never happens in real life, so I was already skeptical. He was drawing a zombie. ‚ÄúAnd now you see, the zombies chin is like a chimpanzees bubblecopter asparagus. (Wait what? Lets try this again) And now you see, the zombies chinos like a‚Ä¶ Well‚Ä¶ A line.‚Äù‚Äùwhy does the zombie look like its from the Simpsons?‚Äù‚Äùbecause real zombies are too scary for you kids. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not drawing the ones from the walking dead, for example.‚Äù‚ÄùI‚Äôve seen that movie!‚Äù‚Äùyeah me too!!‚Äù‚Äùumm.. Ok, how many of you guys have seen the walking dead?‚Äù*everyone puts their hand up* the only reason I thought that story was funny is because that kind of thing only happens in movies. What‚Äôs up with the saying, ‚Äòeasy as pie‚Äô? Like what the hooey! Pie is really hard to make. The pie crust always ends up being soggy.‚Äôpiece of cake‚Äô is a saying too! What‚Äôs with all these people that think baking is easy! (Now that I think about it, this is a weird thing to be mad about). Maybe I just need to calm down. NOOOO!!! In section 888 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook it says that the king of oddly colored farm animal (that‚Äôs me!) hereby declares that the sayings ‚Äòeasy as pie‚Äô and ‚Äòpiece of cake‚Äô are now changed to ‚Äòeasy as bread‚Äô and ‚Äòpiece of bread‚Äô. I just realised that I was typing with my phone in portrait mode! Now I turned it into landscape and I feel so freeeeeee!!! I need to come up with other things that I do randomly‚Ä¶ Like the rainbow fluffysheep hanbooks challenge booklet subset! If I am talking about some random subject, I will now randomly put a challenge for you, the reader (which probably doesn‚Äôt exist) to do! Piece of bread! In section 7 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbooks challenge booklet subset it STATES that your challenge is: get anyone you know to say piece of bread instead of piece of cake! (They probably won‚Äôt do it unless you tell them the reason (or you have really good friends)) i have to shorten the rainbow fluffysheep handbooks challenge booklet subset so that I don‚Äôt have to write the rainbow fluffysheep handbooks challenge booklet subset all of the time. From now on, it is considered TRFSHCBS. I probably news to add vowels to pronounce it. And take out ‚Äòthe‚Äô. RAFLUSHEHACHABOOS. Pronounced ra-fluh-shee-ha-cha-boo-s. that‚Äôll work. I need to write more to fill my writer quota. That just sounded cool to say. I probably write about‚Ä¶ 100 words a day. Well I started today at the zombie thing, so yea. What‚Äôs going to be the next big thing in the future? Technically, I‚Äôm writing this in the past, so you guys can email me at rainbowfluffysheep123@gmail.com and tell me what the future‚Äôs like! The only problem is that I will only receive it in the future. Another one of my BRILLIANT ideas gone down the tubes. Goodbye. The world is unjust! I worked for hours on end, making an app for a coding competition. And then they announced‚Ä¶ We made it to the country finals! The COUNTRY! By that time, my app had over 5,000 downloads! It was amazing. But we came in second. Guess what the prize was for second?!?! TAKE A WILD GUESS!!!! NOTHING! This wouldn‚Äôt have been so bad, but at the competition they were giving away free stuff. And GUESS WHO GOT SAID FREE STUFF?!?! MY BROTHER, THAT‚ÄôS WHO!!! So in the end, after spending half the year doing a competition, my brother, who did absolutely nothing, got more out of it then me. The world is unjust! Unfair! Prejudiced! Biased! Fascist! (Wait, that was autocorrected). I just needed to get my anger out. When I wrote autocorrected, it autocorrected it to autocorrect ex! That‚Äôs the last time i buy an apple product. How many devices companies are fruit? There‚Äôs apple obviously, and blackberry, and pear (I‚Äôve seen pear shops in cities) and raspberries (as in the greatest computer of all time, raspberry pi). That could be the most expensive fruit salad ever! What would you like to order, moisuer? I‚Äôll have the fruit salad. Oui, oui. Harold! That costs $5k! So? I bet it‚Äôs good! KSHHH and here‚Äôs how the skit would have went if I had autocorrect on. Why would you like to order, moisture? You guys have moisture in this restaurant? that‚Äôs not up to the code for restaurants. i‚Äôll have to tell the building inspector! Oh yes, anyway, I‚Äôll have the fruit salad. Out, out! Runnnn! I‚Äôm coming Harold! That waiter must have something about fruit salad! Maybe he had a bad experience as a child. Wow, I sure went off on a tangent. Do you think that it would be cool if apple made all their devices different fruit names! The iPad pro could be the watermelon, cause its so big. And the iPhone nano could be the strawberry (other berry names are trademarked) what else? A phone with a lot of space could be the peach, because the pit is like the hard-drive! (That was a bit far fetched) and the MacBook could be an orange because when you open it it it cut in the inside‚Ä¶ Cuz laptops are like two parts‚Ä¶ You know? (and if you cut a grape in half and put it in the microwave it will make plasma (just thought you‚Äôd like to know that)) Earbuds could be cherries because they always have the two cherries which are like the ear things! And they‚Äôd call the charger ‚ÄòThe Root‚Äô. Why a great idea! I will let apple use these names and I only need a 0.00000000000001% share In the company. Even though I did work hard at this. I just thought of something amazing! If you are in a shop and you see a jar of nondescript sauces (mayacamole) and it costs two bucks. TWO BUCKS!!! You know for a FACT that the shop just across town sells them for one-fifty. The shop is five minutes away. If you choose to go to the shop, then you my friend are working for minimum wage! (Except in the case that you have to walk back. If so, just buy the mayacamole at the former option( or just get salsa. It‚Äôs on sale! (Which probably means that its old))) wasn‚Äôt that interesting? Here‚Äôs another situation. You are buying a $400,000 home (average price right now I‚Äôd say) and you think ‚Äúwhat a steal!‚Äù And your neighbour thinks ‚Äúwhere did i put that shotgun cartridge again? But is you think about it you are working for 1,667 weeks to pay for that! (Assuming 8 hours a day, five days a week at minimum wage) That‚Äôs 32 YEARS! Let‚Äôs say you work for 12 hours a day, seven days a week for $20 an hour, that‚Äôs still 238 weeks! That‚Äôs still five years! Just buy a camper van for goodness sake! I just got to thinking; how many tiny changes would a cereal company have to make to earn twice as much from a box of cereal? (Assuming people still bought the same amount ( I think I can trust the general population)) it turns out that if we want to double the profits by decreasing things by ten percent, we would have to do it seven times. Which means instead of selling these cornflakes: Box height: 1 meter; Box length: 1 meter; Box width: 1 meter; Percent of cornflake that is cornflake ( not air): 100%; Percent of box filled with bag: 100%; Percent of bag filled with cornflakes: 100%; Production cost: 10 cents; they could sell these: Box height, width & length: 0.9 meters; Percent of cornflake that is cornflake ( not air): 90%; Percent of box filled with bag: 90%; Percent of bag filled with cornflakes: 90%; Production cost: 9 cents; they would make double the profits! Hooray! Well that‚Äôs that. You know how people always have weird names on the interweb? Well I came up with Internet name generator! (Random adjective)(Random noun)(Use a deck of cards for this part. Take out the jokers and face cards, and tens are now zeros. Pick out numbers until you get a club) additional things include: (pick a card. If it is three or lower, put X at the start and end)(pick a card. If it is an ace, replace noun with random country. If it is a two, replace noun with Internet related company + fan.) let me try this. Here is what I got: FoulSoup31, XxInternalAle10xX, StrengthenedFillet49458, MediocreElectrode20, and EpicRedditFan7515. That was a lot more accurate than I thought it would be. Bye. Hello! I need to rant more! I am going to start a sentence without knowing where it is leading. I wish I could buy a mocha for my clown pants while aliens eat your toes which glisten in the sliver of wind. That was fun. Why is orange so popular? There are SO MANY WORDS that don‚Äôt rhyme with other words too, like engine, silver and angry (hangry isn‚Äôt a real word as far as I know). And people know that orange rhymes with ‚Äúdoor hinge‚Äù! Some people say that doesn‚Äôt count. But there is another! Sporangia! Well, it‚Äôs pretty close. I think it‚Äôs like fern spores. Well remember, whenever you see the color orange, type #boycottorange, so people stop taking pictures of orange things. For Halloween, people will carve watermelons instead of pumpkins. Trump will no longer be president because of his orange skin. Oranges (the fruit) will be replaced by reds! (The soon to be fruit). The sun will disappear, or if we want to not go extinct, just change its color to blue. I have a map of Europe on my wall, which has the countries in different colors. BEWARE IF YOU LIVE IN: The UK, Spain, Hungary, Latvia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Greece, Denmark and Armenia. You guys will soon disappear off the face of the earth. And my favourite pop is club orange! Nooooo! And Jupiter will disappear too! Now that I think about it, losing orange things wouldn‚Äôt be that bad compared to other colors. Like blue. We would lose water, blue paint, the second book in the Rust comic book series, the sky, Pluto and that one triple angry bird. That would be awful. In section 255 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook it STATES that the king of oddly colors farm animals (me again) will never make all blue things disappear, but he may make all orange things disappear. Now you guys don‚Äôt have to worry! :)! Why are kings higher than queens in a deck of cards? That‚Äôs really sexist! People think that king is worth thirteen and queens are worth twelve! (If you can‚Äôt tell, I‚Äôm mocking that people that get offended by everything). Why do vegetarians worry about hurting animals, but not plants!?!? Plants have feelings too (I think)! In fact, vegetarians kill MORE than carnivores. Instead of a whole family eating a chicken, if they are all vegetarians, then they will probably kill hundreds of plants! Think about THAT, people! In this whole LoTeEv, I have probably offended a lot of you guys. Sorry bout that. In section 1029384756 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook it says that if the mug of oddly colored farm animals (me again) offends any reader, he is sincerely sorry *citation not needed because of section 12345679 of the RFSH*. Why are the money symbols not consistent? Like there‚Äôs ‚Ç¨uros, ¬•en and ¬£ounds. But why $ollars? Maybe it‚Äôs supposed to be dollar$. That makes more sense. Now I won‚Äôt get that nervous eye twitch every time I see that symbol. ‚ÄúHey look, I just found this ten dollar bill on the ground! Hey why the flop is he doing that?‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ a Thing that he does‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúOh.‚Äù ‚ÄúI have a great idea for this! Whenever he gets near money his eye twitches! That means we can find money on the ground just by watching him!‚Äù And that‚Äôs how I lost all my friends. It turns out that was the only reason they liked me. Wait what is this ?? That is so ?eird. Goodbye. I‚Äôm back! Hahahaha gotcha! I was just kidding about that. But you would have never known that! I‚Äôm going to try to make words using only the top row of letters. Hmmmm‚Ä¶ Lets see. Tip, rip, port, type, write, writer, typewriter. Fascinating. I‚Äôm going to make a fake movie trailer. Using only words. Here we go: [Have you ever‚Ä¶]{scene of old woman churning milk}[wanted to‚Ä¶]{scene of older woman churning what is now cream(the reason she is older is not because it is a different person, but because we filmed it after}[churn your own butter?!?!]{scene of even older woman churning what is now butter (the reason she is even older is because we got a new actor because the other one retired (she used to put tires on her vehicle, and now she does it again))}[This is a great movie, if you are an IDIOT][‚Äúthis is a great movie‚Äù][i had popcorn while I watched this movie, and I really enjoyed it, it soothed the pain of having to watch that movie][‚ÄúI really enjoyed it, it really soothed‚Äù][i actually really enjoyed the movie!][wait‚Ä¶ What? You know we‚Äôre not paying you guys right? Oh. Anyway, ‚ÄúI actually really enjoyed the movie!‚Äù][while being on an oil rig?!?!]{well‚Ä¶ No, but anyway (shows a picture of an old woman churning butter which is thick and black and worth a lot more than butter)}[Coming soon to you][this summer][and fall][and winter as well][lets just add spring too][The Lard of the Rigs] That was actually fun! {Warning: if you use this movie name you will BE SUED actually now that I think about it you probably won‚Äôt. In fact, if you DO actually make this into a movie, send it to me} Do you guys think I‚Äôm random enough? I really hope so! In section 5647382910 of the RAFLUSHE ‚Äì I can‚Äôt remember. That challengey things name. But anyway, make that movie. Plz. I‚Äôm board. And not just any old barn-wood planks, mind you, but a board of fine stained oak as the flooring in the White House. By!!! I‚Äôm back! No, just kidding, I‚Äôm front! I have a topic that I‚Äôm actually very serious about. Puzzles. Am I the only one that thinks that puzzles are the most useless thing in the world?!?! That‚Äôs like the PROOF that the human race have made it too far. When we actually make challenges that we have to face OURSELVES, AND WE PAY FOR THEM! We are literally paying to give ourselves problems! We have enough problems! Well at least I do ;). Probprobprobprobleeeeeemsomomo! I‚Äôm going to type something about politics to sound super cool. As you know, recently president Obama (That was like years ago) oh‚Ä¶ Sozsozsoz. As you know, recently president Nixon (no, that‚Äôs not exactly right) Oh yea, I forgot. As you know, recently president Lincoln (ARGH! We are not doing this anymore) was a president before Donald (finally) Duck! (Nooooo! It‚Äôs TRUMP) What? No! You think you‚Äôre SOOO smart person who talks in the brackets. Actually, trump is a businessman in that show where he says YOU‚ÄôRE FIRED!!! What, you probably also think that a bodybuilder actor that says ‚ÄúGEAT TOUW THAE CHAEOPPAER‚Äù is a governor too!?! Hahahaha‚Ä¶ Donald Duck was a great president. His slogan was ‚ÄúI will fight for american democrats‚Äù and he bathes in gold. What a great job. Money is so dirty though! Now that I think about it, he probably gets the money wholesale from the mint. Or else, how could he afford it?! I have a new segment in my text now! It‚Äôs called the ‚ÄúRandom Fun Fact‚Äù segment! (Now that I think about it, I never know when to use those ‚Äú. I think it‚Äôs ‚Äú‚Äù when someone is talking and ‚Äù for saying something sarcastically or shortening a word. For example: ‚ÄúHello there Chuckie! How‚Äôya doing ‚Äònice guy‚Äô. Were you being sarcastic? Yes, but how could you see the little apostrophes when I‚Äôm talking to you?‚Ä¶ Science.‚Äù And that‚Äôs how they work) where was I? Random fax! I will send all of my readers a fax with has facts on in! How brilliant! The facts of the paragraph are‚Ä¶ Ice cream was invented in china, something that is ‚Äòblue‚Äô (got it right there!) Is actually every color BUT blue, and I like cheese. And the country of the paragraph is‚Ä¶ Mexico! Why not, right? Did you ever wonder how records work? (Just in case you don‚Äôt know, a record is a thingy where you put a round black thing on a majig and it puts a sharp whatchamacallit on that and funny rhythmic sound emerge and tickle your ear holes) I know how they WORK, with ridges and diaphragms and blah Blah BLah BLAh BLAH‚Ä¶ But how do they WORK?!?! Like who was sitting there in their layzboy having diet Pepsi (or popsee to avoid copyright infringement (and that‚Äôs when I checked my forehead, and sure enough, there was a mint there)) And then they realise‚Ä¶ Hey! Bumpy things can make sounds! I just can‚Äôt get my head around it (clockwise is my preference). Do you ever wonder what the worst collections are in the world? I currently collect words, pins and the ‚Äúto kill a mockingbird‚Äù series (not much work ( besides the fact that I have to give them (it) back to the library by tomorrow morning ( the last time I will ever bring a library book late again is when I borrowed the book entitled ‚ÄòHow to sharpen a pencil for dummies‚Äô (Don‚Äôt blame me! It was the ‚ÄòExtended and revised‚Äô edition! They had all the technical ‚Äòlead vs. graphite‚Äô stuff added.) an they called out my name over the loudspeaker telling me to return the book immediately or I would be fired (yes, I worked at the library (I never could figure out the Dewey decimal system)). Now that I think about it, they never said what book to bring, they just said my name. Oh no, I never handed in the ‚Äòhow to sharpen a pen for dummies‚Äô book! (Which I rate a 3/5, ‚Äúwould not borrow again‚Äù because of its poor layout and overall structure (although the information was altogether helpful)) what collections do YOU have reader? Find out next time on ‚Äúdeer or no deer!‚Äù (Remember forehead sweets) oh no! I wrote how to kill a mocking bird! I meant ‚Äòpow do gill hamma (hammer) king turd‚Äô. Phew. Got outta that one. I have a new topic! A high-quality, name-brand, box-not-bag topic! I figured out a great business plan! Make onsies! Not just out of clothes, but out of everything! Like: Did you eat two bowls of granola this morning? Well ONSIE! [poured granola into one bowl, causing it to be crushed under its own weight] do you have two hands? Well ONSIE! [handshakes himself] Do you have twins? Well ONSIE! [wait‚Ä¶ How is this supposed to work?] Get yours now at your local Amazon (which might not be very accessible if you don‚Äôt live in South America) for a free trial! *happy tune* Onsie, Onesie! Life is better with a onsie. Spin a web, less than two. ONSIE! (I think that was to the tune of Spider-Man (I mean Smiter-Can) Onsies only cost‚Ä¶ Whatever you want them to cost! Yeah, I think i‚Äôm going to go now. Baiii! Wait.. What? When did i wrote that ONSIE thing?? I just came back and I do not remember doing that. What the hat does ‚ÄòSpin a web, less than two‚Äù even mean? That is some weird stuff. So today I listened to that radio station again, and it was totally worth it. He was talking about these married people in Germany that are going to a Walking Dead convention for their 17th anniversary. Weird. Weird, weird, WEIRD!!! You know guitar tuna? Probably not. It is an app where you tune your guitar (obviously). I thought of how they could make so much more money! If they had bass tuna, electric guitar tuna, acoustic guitar tuna. BUT THEY WOULD ALL BE THE SAME THING!!! They would make so much money! Wait. What about canned tuna! (Also, if they thought in that way, then bass tuna would be extremely perplexing because they are both fish). Well, that‚Äôs my stuff for today! Hallo! I‚Äôm back! And I don‚Äôt get house decorations nowadays. People put old stuff in their house, and they think it makes it look amazing! People always talk about that ‚ÄòVintage Look‚Äô which is just putting old stuff that people fifty years ago would have said ‚Äúwhy do you have a *fill in the blank with an old thing* in your HOUSE?!?!‚Äù In their house. I should rant. Like what I‚Äôm doing now. I‚Äôm just talking about random things just like the flaming chicken person does just to fill up space on the page. I should also write long words like pnumonoultramicrkscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis and disestablishmentarianism . Actually, since it only matters for words count, I should just type really small words. Hi, my name is jo. (Its not actually, but I need to type small words). I eat a lot of pie and I love it too. It is yum in my tum. Wow that was probably really boring to read (and to write). Hello there, reader! I‚Äôve just decided that I want to talk to you. I always seem to do all of the talking, but maybe I should give you a chance! *really really long drawn out super weird and uneventful awkward silence*. Oh I see what‚Äôs happening. Either you can‚Äôt talk to me because you are in the future and I‚Äôm in the past, causing us to not be able to communicate due to the sad reality that is the third dimension, or‚Ä¶ Your trying to talk to me on a walkie-talkie! I could never figure out those things either. They‚Äôre so confusing. Lets see‚Ä¶ Oh, there it is! The ‚Äòwalkie-talkie almanac: a complete collection of all the knowledge YOU will need to acquire (did you know acquire is also a board game? If you are ever playing, always buy America, and then buy quantum stocks (well it worked that one time I played (are you saying that games are DIFFERENT every time you play them!?!? (That‚Äôs the last time I mesmerise fifty-three rounds of go fish))) to use your very own‚Ä¶ WALKIE-TALKIE! (well what else would the walkie-talkie almanac be about!?!?) lets see‚Ä¶ Contents‚Ä¶ It says the contents page is on page 1‚Ä¶ Wait ‚Äì WHAT?!?! The contents page has a line for the contents page! That‚Äôs like a website having a link to itself! (Which is not a bad idea for my own website to get a lot of views (like I could a a tab on my website called ‚Äúthe best sites on the web! And I would have links to places like YouTube and twitter (or whatever you young‚Äôuns go to these days! When I was a lad I used to play ‚ÄòPok√©mon Pearl‚Äô and ‚ÄòFacebook‚Äô now you kids are all on her newfangled ‚ÄòPok√©mon Go get outta here‚Äô and yer ‚ÄòSnapperChatters‚Äô (i bet if you are reading this in ten years you won‚Äôt know that I was talking about Pokemon go and snapchat (or how I got from talking to you to young ones (btw: if you are reading this in 2028 or beyond: welcome to the distant past! (Now that in think about it, I started reading the longest text ever by ‚ÄòSam‚Äô (real readers will know who that is) when it was about ten years too! And I don get the references to stuff like ‚Äòneopets‚Äô and ‚ÄòThe Matrix‚Äô))))))) Okay where is it‚Ä¶ Oh there; it says that the ‚Äòpretty much how to use it‚Äô section is on page -3! Well thats eas- how do I go to page -3! Lets see‚Ä¶ Oh look! They have a ‚Äòhow to go to negative pages section too! It‚Äôs on page -7. Noooo!! I guess I‚Äôll just look it up on the Internet. Ok first you have to turn the book into antimatter‚Ä¶ Ok got that done‚Ä¶ Now just turn to the page without the negative! Well that was easy. I‚Äôm on page 7 now. It says all you have to do is convert the book into an antimatter form and- hey this sounds familiar! I‚Äôll go to page three now. It says here, and I quote: ‚Äúto use the walkie talkie, hold in that little button on the side o the walkie talkie‚Äù. Did you that reader! Can you try talking to me now? Oh yes! I can hear you! Oh wait, I‚Äôm on the wrong station. I‚Äôm on number five, but your on number six. I have to click a button to change my station number! Too much work. Do you think I‚Äôm crazy because I talk to myself? I‚Äôm not! Yes you are. I am not! Isn‚Äôt talking to yourself the DEFINITION of crazy? I‚Äôm not talking to myself. The who do you think I am? Oh yea. I‚Äôm your imaginary friend, RatGuy! Don‚Äôt you remember me! No. Oh *sniffle* well *odd breathing patterns* we *tear emerging from eyeball* used *pure weeping* to- I CAN‚ÄôT TALK TO YOU WHEN YOUR CRYING BECAUSE YOU KEEP INTERRUPTING YOURSELF! Technically, since you‚Äôre talking to yourself your also interrupting your self. I guess I am. Continue, RatGuy. As I was saying: we used to skate around on a skateboard together. We would have so much fun doing tricks that other kids could have only DREAMED of, like the ‚Äòground ollie‚Äô and the ‚Äòdown-the-curb‚Äô. We moved at speeds that the other kids couldn‚Äôt even begin to imagine. 90% the speed of light. But RatGuy?
